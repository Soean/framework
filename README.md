### Assely is a PHP framework which brings a little joy to the WordPress development. Develop structured, easily scalable and complex WordPress websites and web applications with truly pleasure.

Today, WordPress development is pretty rough and messy. The Assely framework aims to introduce some standarized and comfortable ways for creating WordPress powered applications. We still have a long way to go, but we believe that it is possible. Take a look at what is waiting for you:

- Powerful [Custom Fields](https://assely.org/docs/field-types)
- [Laravel Blade templates](https://assely.org/docs/blade-templates)
- Diagnostic, scaffording, managing, even your own custom [Commands](https://assely.org/docs/command)
- Scaffording custom [Post Types](https://assely.org/docs/posttype), [Taxonomies](https://assely.org/docs/taxonomy), [Metaboxes](https://assely.org/docs/metabox) in seconds
